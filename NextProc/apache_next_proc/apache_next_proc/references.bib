	abstract = {Public procurement accounts for a 14% of the annual budget of the different governments of the European Union. In Europe, contracting processes are classified using Common Procurement Vocabulary codes (CPVs), a taxonomy designed to facilitate statistical reporting, search and the creation of alerts that can be used by potential bidders. CPVs are commonly assigned manually by public employees in charge of contracting processes. However, CPV classification is not a trivial task, as there are more than 9,000 different CPV categories, which are often assigned following heterogeneous criteria. In this paper we have created a CPV classifier that uses as an input the textual description of the contracting process, and assigns CPVs from the 45 top-level CPV categories. We work only with texts in Spanish, although our approach may be easily extended to other languages. Our results improve the state of the art (10% F1-score improvement) and are available online.},

ABSTRACT = {Governments need to be accountable and transparent for their public spending decisions in order to prevent losses through fraud and corruption as well as to build healthy and sustainable economies. Open data act as a major instrument in this respect by enabling public administrations, service providers, data journalists, transparency activists, and regular citizens to identify fraud or uncompetitive markets through connecting related, heterogeneous, and originally unconnected data sources. To this end, in this article, we present our experience in the case of Slovenia, where we successfully applied a number of anomaly detection techniques over a set of open disparate data sets integrated into a Knowledge Graph, including procurement, company, and spending data, through a linked data-based platform called TheyBuyForYou. We then report a set of guidelines for publishing high quality procurement data for better procurement analytics, since our experience has shown us that there are significant shortcomings in the quality of data being published. This article contributes to enhanced policy making by guiding public administrations at local, regional, and national levels on how to improve the way they publish and use procurement-related data; developing technologies and solutions that buyers in the public and private sectors can use and adapt to become more transparent, make markets more competitive, and reduce waste and fraud; and providing a Knowledge Graph, which is a data resource that is designed to facilitate integration across multiple data silos by showing how it adds context and domain knowledge to machine-learning-based procurement analytics.},

abstract="Public procurement is a large market affecting almost every organisation and individual. Governments need to ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive, and vibrant economies. In this context, we built a platform, consisting of a set of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse, and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement knowledge graph. We developed end-user tools on top of the knowledge graph for anomaly detection and cross-lingual document search. This paper describes our experiences and challenges faced in creating such a platform and knowledge graph and demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web technologies for enhancing public procurement.",
